This platform summarizes information on each of 5906 genes overlapping the 424 loci identified for eGFRcrea  based on a GWAS meta-analysis of UK Biobank data and CKDGen consortium data (n=1,201,909) [Stanzick et al. Nat. Commun. 2021] . Focussed on European ancestry (n=1,004,040) , 594 independent signals across the 424 loci were identified using approximate conditioned analysis. For each variant in these 594 signals, the posterior probability of association (PPA) was computed and, for each signal, a 99% credible set of variants was derived (i.e. smallest set of variants with >99% cumultative PPA). Credible (set) variants are considered the most likely variants to drive the association signal (particularly those with high PPA).
